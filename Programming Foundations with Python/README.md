# Programming Foundations with Python

I completed this course in May, 2016 as part of my MLND.

I'll checkin my solutions of homework and final project once the course changes its material.

## About this Course

In this introductory programming class, you’ll learn Object-Oriented Programming, a must-have technique for software engineers that will allow you to reuse and share code easily. You’ll learn by doing, and will build byte-sized (ha!) mini projects in each lesson to learn and practice programming concepts.

We’ve heard that programming can be intimidating for newcomers, and we’ve created this course to make sure that you have a great learning experience! You’ll learn actively with our mini projects (see the awesome list below), which you’ll be able to share proudly with your friends. You’ll also learn important programming concepts one by one, with no surprises or leaps of logic along the way.

You’ll pick up some great tools for your programming toolkit in this course! You will:

Start coding in the programming language Python;
Reuse and share code with Object-Oriented Programming;
Create and share amazing, life-hacking projects!
This introductory course is for you if you want to be a software engineer, or if you want to collaborate with programmers. Mastering Object-Oriented Programming will propel your career in tech forward, and it’s also a great way to learn how software engineers think about solving problems.
