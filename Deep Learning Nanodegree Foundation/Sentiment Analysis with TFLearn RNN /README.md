# Sentiment Analysis with TFLearn RNN

This notebook uses [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/) to train a Sentiment Analyzer on a set of [IMDB Movie ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). Once trained, given some input text, it will be able to classify it as either positive or negative. The neural network that is built for this is a [recurrent network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network). It uses a technique called [LSTM](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).
