# Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we will build a deep network from scratch that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative just based on their text!

### Project Outline:

- Curate a Dataset
- Developing a "Predictive Theory"
- **STEP 1**: Quick Theory Validation
- Transforming Text to Numbers
- **STEP 2**: Creating the Input/Output Data
- Putting it all together in a Neural Network
- **STEP 3**: Building our Neural Network
- Understanding Neural Noise
- **STEP 4**: Making Learning Faster by Reducing Noise
- Analyzing Inefficiencies in our Network
- **STEP 5**: Making our Network Train and Run Faster
- Further Noise Reduction
- **STEP 6**: Reducing Noise by Strategically Reducing the Vocabulary
- Analysis: What's going on in the weights?
