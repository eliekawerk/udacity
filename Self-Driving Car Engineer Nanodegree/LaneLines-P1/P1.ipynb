    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "This exercise was on the easy side. I just kinna followed the code in the quizes and got it to work. That been said, I have a suspicion that it is not going to be such a case going forward. I noticed all the videos stopped right before the car hits a curve. My guess is our current implementation will not work for curves and possibly many other scenarios.\n",

    "Ah! After scolling further down and executing below cells, my suspicion came true. Indeed our current implementation is not robust and needs more work. Perhaps, we will tackle these scenarios in coming classes.  \n",

    "I also appreciate the amount of work openCV is doing for us here. Implementating these algorithms from scratch would be a full time job. :)"
